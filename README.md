SpaceX, a pioneering company in the commercial space age, has revolutionized space travel by making it more affordable. The Falcon 9 rocket launches, advertised on the company's website, boast a cost of 62 million dollars, significantly undercutting other providers. A key contributor to these savings is SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage. This project aims to predict whether SpaceX will reuse the first stage based on public information and machine learning models.

Questions to be Answered
How do variables such as payload mass, launch site, number of flights, and orbits impact the success of the first stage landing?
Does the rate of successful landings increase over the years?
What is the optimal algorithm for binary classification in this case?
